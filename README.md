# ST-TestProject - Langton's Ant
#
HOW TO USE:
1. After launching the program, a window will pop-up. If the window is blank, adjust the window size and the GUI should appear
2. To generate the pattern, press the 'Start' button
3. The pattern will continue to generate until the 'ant' walks off the edge of the 'canvas', or the program is closed
4. You can hit the 'Start' button a second time after the program has stopped and the 'ant' will continue from the centre square

Note:
<br>*Directions and colours are hard coded into Util.java
<br>*ColourReference[] defines the order colours, tiles will change colour sequentially according this array
<br>*The method getDirection() defines which direction to turn on each colour, these can be swapped around as required to generate certain patterns
